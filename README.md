A REACT.js frontend with a Javascript backend that takes user prompt and scrapes relevant sources and cites them in a chosen academic format. 

The tool uses REACT.js to take the user input and sends it to an AI as a JSON file. The AI will then compare the prompt with scrapped information from sources that are not part of the blacklist. Then it will be sent to another web scraper that will cite the source accordingly.
